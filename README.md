Attached is my solution to the InquirED front end developer coding challenge.

I decided to manage state primarily with hooks, although in retrospect if given the opportunity
to start over, this would have been a good time to use Redux.

I am quite novice level in Typescript, but incorporated it where I could!

The following packages were imported for styling and customization purposes:
    - react-bootstrap : primarily for the react-bootstrap-modal
    - material-table : this was my first time using this package and it is great!
    - react-toastify: a great confirmation alert package - used for edit/create/delete.

Being a freelance learner and developer up to this point, I do see some areas for improvement,
but I wanted to submit this solution to you in a timely fashion. 

I am humbled by this opportunity and appreciate it immensely!
